# SwengMetricVisualisation

This project gives a visualisation of data.

First, if the repos button is clicked, a bar chart will be displayed with the top 20 GitHub pages by stargazers count.
I have given the bar chart a label of both the name of the github page and the stargazers count.

Secondly, if the commits button is clicked, an input box will appear.
This will ask the user to input an owner name and a repo name. 
Once this has been entered the user can press the submit button and a graph will be displayed.
This graph will tell and show the user the name of each person that has committed to the repo and how many commits they have made.
